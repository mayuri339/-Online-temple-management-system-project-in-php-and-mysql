The online temple management system uses PHP and MYSQL to store user information (devotees), manage contributions, and schedule darshans. A number of challenges have been addressed, including donation records, devotee databases, and festival records. Temple management software has been designed with a simple user interface and navigation system to make performing tasks easy. The integration of a number of modules also allows the generation of relevant reports in real-time. There is a reason why every individual is born into this world, but they are never born into the same world. However, they all seek the same thing, and they all believe that God created everyone and resides within everyone. Some people believe God lives in their houses or can be felt there, so they should go there to be touched by God's grace. Every religion worships God differently, and there are many religions around the world. Temples are common places of worship in Hinduism. Most temples in the area are not well known for their grace, so fewer people tend to visit them. Due to people wanting darshans at their convenience at the same time as they had work to do or proper management to manage, darshans became very difficult. During the booking process, Darshans must be booked at the given time and devotional artis must be booked at a time convenient for the users. After paying a nominal fee, the temple management system will arrange for the queue to perform the necessary worship besides filling out the details and the timing. Temple management will arrange for the required worship to be performed, and tokens will be required for entry. It will therefore be possible for them to have darshans at any time that is convenient for them without any hesitation as a result.Manage temple activities with temple management software, an all-in-one solution. User-friendly and automated temple management software has been developed. Temple management software can be used even by those without much computer knowledge. Temple management software can be easily operated using a keyboard. Accounting temple stores and other temple activities can be handled manually by following the manual procedure.An Online Temple Management System in PHP allows temple administrations to manage devotees' donations, manage darshan bookings, and store the data of users (devotees). Online Temple Management Software automates the management and administration of temple organizations. Among the challenges are the integration of donation management, devotee databases, and festival management modules. Temple management software has an easy-to-use interface and straightforward navigation.
